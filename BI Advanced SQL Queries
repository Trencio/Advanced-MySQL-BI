-- 1. First, I'd like to show our volume growth can you pull session and order volume, trended by quarter for the life of the business? 
-- since the most recent quarter is incomplete, you can decide how to handle it. 

select 
year(website_sessions.created_at) as yr,
quarter(website_sessions.created_at) as qtr,
count(distinct website_sessions.website_session_id) as sessions,
count(distinct orders.order_id) as orders
from website_sessions 
left join orders
on website_sessions.website_session_id = orders.website_session_id
group by 1,2
order by 1,2

-- 2. Next, let's showcase all of our efficiency improvements, i would love to show quarterly figures since we launched, 
-- for session-to-order conversion rate, revenue per order, and revenue per session. 

select

quarter(website_sessions.created_at) as qtr,
count(distinct orders.order_id) / count(distinct website_sessions.website_session_id) as session_to_order_cov_rate,

-- 3. i'd like to show how we've grown specific channels. Could you pull a quartely view of orders from Gsearch nonbrand,
-- Bsearch nonbrand, brand search overall, organic search, and direct type-in?

select

-- 4. Next, let's show the overall session-to-order conversion rate trends for those 
-- same channels, by quarter. Please also make a note of any periods where we made major improvements or optimizations

-- 5. we've come a long way since the days of selling a single product. Let's pull monthly trending for revenue and margin by product, along with total sales and revenue.
